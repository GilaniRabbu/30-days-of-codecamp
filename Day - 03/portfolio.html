    <p>
        I designed and developed a responsive website for
        a local business using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        The site features a clean layout and is optimized
        for both desktop and mobile devices.

    <h3 style="color: seagreen;">Project 2: E-commerce Platform</h3>
    <p>
        For this project, I worked with a team to create a custom
        e-commerce platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a
        back-end framework. The platform allows customers to browse
        products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.
